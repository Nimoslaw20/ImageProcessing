# ImageProcessing

As an addition to my senior year capstone, this respository contains
the image processing code for image comparison. It uses python libraries 
such as numpy, listdir, os, matplot, etc. The program loads ans stores an already given folder of images, 
when a new image is passed to it using a commandline.
It extract the pixels of the new image and compares it to the already stored pixels from the given folder.
It returns True when the pixels match, False, when there isa difference.
